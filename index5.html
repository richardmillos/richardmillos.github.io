<p>Youthful insecurities kept me from fully expressing love, too young to understand the complications and complexities of baring my emotion for people to trample it, crush it, or simply ignore it. But I knew I tried to love. That for me was enough no matter how the adult world tried to underrate my ability to feel and to express what I feel in a way I deemed appropriate. I was so young then, barely 14, when I felt so sure that I was starting to fall in love with a very beautiful girl of my age. We were high school classmates. For reasons of privacy, I will not mention her name here. We both have already moved on. Now she is living a happy life with somebody she loves and loves her in return. She is also running after her dreams like what I am doing. Then, life was simpler. We were too innocent to care about the future. What is to become of us after a year, a month, or even the following week was the least of our concern. For us then the present was the only thing that mattered. She was from another elementary school in the poblacion; and being first year high school students then, we were too shy to approach anyone we think a stranger. She caught everyone’s attention, including mine, because she’s beautiful. In that public high school where I graduated from, it was rare to see a beautiful girl who dresses so well and modest all at the same time. You either see a pretty girl who looks drab, a well-dressed one but just too provincial, or both good-looking and nicely-dressed but an epitome of egotism and pride.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I choose this love story because this story describes a people fell in love with another but the other person did not know about their feelings. It is a common theme in many love stories, but this one has a unique twist to it. The story revolves around a young man named Jack. Jack had been in love with his best friend, Emma, for years. But every time he tried to tell her about his feelings, he just couldn't bring himself to do it. He was afraid of ruining their friendship if his feelings were not reciprocated. Emma, on the other hand, was completely oblivious to Jack's feelings. She saw him only as a friend, and nothing more. She had no idea that Jack was secretly in love with her. Despite trying his best to keep his feelings hidden, there were moments when Jack couldn't help himself. Sometimes he would stare at Emma with such intensity that he feared she would notice. And although Emma wouldn't consciously pick up on these signs, she couldn't help but feel that there was something more to her friendship with Jack.&nbsp; Isn it facennating?</p>
